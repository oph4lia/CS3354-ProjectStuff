## Part A: Formulating SRS
#### Functional Requirements
| FR | Description | Priority |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| FR1 | The player must be able to move their ship horizontally across the bottom of the screen using keyboard arrow keys or A/D keys. The ship should move smoothly with appropriate speed. The ship's movement should be constrained to the screen boundaries. | 1 |
| FR2 | Enemies should be able to shoot projectiles down the screen toward the player at random intervals. The projectiles should move at an appropriate speed and should cause player damage upon collision. | 2 |

#### Non-Functional Requirements 
| NFR | Description | Clarification | Operationalization |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| NFR1 | The game must maintain a consistent frame rate of at least 30 frames per second on standard computers. The game should have low latency, ideally with the ability to respond to use input within 50 milliseconds. | Video games like space invaders benefit from higher frames and low latency, as this smoothens the gameplay and makes it a more immersive experience. Space invaders is fast-paced enough to benefit from game performance optimization | FR1, FR2 |
| NFR2 | Greenfoot Invaders must have an intuitive user interface to ensure players can easily understand how to play. | Players should be able to quickly understand the objective of the game, the controls, and status information without excessive instructions. The interface elements should follow gaming conventions and provide clear visual feedback. | FR1 |

#### Traceability between NFR and FR:
| Non-Functional Requirement | Traced to Original Functional Requirements | 
| -------------- | --------------- | 
| NFR1 | FR1, FR2 |
| NFR2 | FR1 |

#### Constraints
| C | Description | 
| -------------- | --------------- | 
| C1 | The game must be developed in Greenfoot environment and be compatible with Greenfoot version 3.7.0 or higher. |
| C2 | Greenfoot Invaders must be completed within the given course deadline with development periods being limited based on team availability and resources |

## Part B: Usecase Model
#### Usecases
| UC1: Player Plays/Starts Game |
| ------- |
| TUCBW: The player selects "Start Game" from the main menu |
| TUCEW: The player begins gameplay with enemies appearing and the ability to move and shoot |

| UC2: Pause/Resume Game |
| ------- |
| TUCBW: The player presses the pause key during active gameplay |
| TUCEW: The player returns to active gameplay or exits to the main menu |

#### Usecase text using 2-column format
UC1. Player Pauses/Resumes game

Preconditions: The game is actively running. The player is in control of their ship.
| Actor: Player | System: Greenfoot Invaders Game |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|1. TUCBW the player presses the pause key (ESC or P) during active gameplay | 2. Game freezes all game entities (player ship, enemies, projectiles) |
| | 3. System displays the pause menu with options: "Resume", "Help", "Settings", and "Quit to Main Menu". |
| 4a. Players selects the "Resume" option | 5a. System hides the pause menu |
| | 6a. System unfreezes all game entities and resumes gameplay |
| 4b. Player selects "Help" option | 5b. System displays the help screen while keeping the game paused | 
| 6b. Player closes the help screen | 7b. System returns to the pause game |
| 4c. Player selects "Quit to Main Menu" option | 5c. System ends the current game session |
| | 6c.System returns tot he main menu screen |
| | 7. TUCEW the player returns to active gameplay or exits to the main menu |
Postconditions: The game state has been updated. Player progress is maintained if gameplay is resumed.

#### Requirement-Use case Traceability Matrix
| Requirement | UC1 | UC2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| FR1 | X | X |
| FR2 | X | X |
| FR3 | X | X |
| FR4 |   | X |
